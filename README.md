# ESP32 IXDI & IXDN IGBT gate driver used for DIY induction heater.

I wanted to build a high power induction heater capable of melting metal, copper, iron, aluminium etc.
Getting it just right turned out be a bit of a project as you can imagine. I picked up a little here and a little there from scouring the internet. Given my inexperience with circuitry and schematics, I needed it to be a simple as possible. I'm always playing around with microcontrollers and I am pretty comfortable coding, so I figured if I could do most the legwork with code, it should keep the circuit design to a minimum. Here is what I came up with.

WIP.
